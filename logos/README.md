# Guidelines for rustronomy branding
TODO: turn this into an actual story, for now, a couple of bullet points will suffice

## Branding
Each rustronomy crate may use a derivative logo of the rustronomy project's logo. Derivative logos consist of the project logo `Rustronomy_github_banner_dark/light.svg` with a subtitle using the extension font (as specified below).

The `Rustronomy_ferris.svg` logo (and derivatives) may be used as the crate's logo in rust documentation.

All logos preferably have a dark and light themed version, if this is necessary for readability reasons.

## Style
**colors**
- rustronomy ferris orange: 0xf66b00ff
- rustronomy logo navy blue: 0x14293aff
- background: no background for both light- and darkmode logos

**fonts** (avaliable for download via [google fonts](https://fonts.google.com))
- rustronomy title font: Fira Code Normal, 410pt
- rustronomy extension font: Montserrat Light Italic, 160pt
