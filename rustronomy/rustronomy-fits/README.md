# Rustronomy-fits - a Rustronomy tool for FITS file I/O
[![License: GPL v3](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-GPLv3-blue.svg)](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0)

_This crate is part of the Rustronomy Project_
Rustronomy-fits provides I/O tools for reading, writing and parsing FITS files. It is currently still under heavy development.

### Features/Roadmap
Rustronomy-fits will support the following features (features marked with ✔️ have already been implemented):

_Reading Fits Files_
- ✔️ Parsing FITS headers and keyword records
- Parsing data in the primary HDU
  - ✔️ Images
  - ❌ Tables
  - ❌ Random Groups
- Parsing Extensions
  - ✔️ Images
  - ❌ Tables
 
_Writing Fits Files_
- Constructing a HDU (including auto header) from
  - ❌ an ndarray (to an Image)
  - ❌ a table (to a table)

# Quickstart
To use Rustronomy-fits in a cargo project, add the rustronomy-fits crate as a dependency to your `Cargo.toml` file:
```toml
[dependencies]
rustronomy-fits = "0.1.0"
```
To use Rustronomy-fits in a Jupyter notebook, execute a cell containing the following code:
```rust
:dep rustronomy-fits = {git = "https://github.com/smups/rustronomy"}
```
### Short example: Importing a FITS image as a ndarray
In this example, we create a Fits struct using the `open()` method, which takes
the path to the file as an argument. Next, we get a reference to the second
header-data-unit (HDU) in the file, wich contains an `f64` encoded Image
extension. We can get the Image from the HDU by matching the data contained in
the HDU with the `Extension::Image` variant and then calling `as_f64_array()` on
the unwrapped Image.
```rust
let fits = Fits::open(&Path::from("somefile.fits"))?;
let data_array = match fits.get_hdu(1).unwrap().get_data() {
  Extension::Image(img) => img.as_f64_array()?,
  _ => panic!()
}; 
```

### Notes on testing
If you want to contribute to this module, please keep in mind the following points regarding testing:
- all I/O tests make use of the `resources/tests/` folder, located in the root of the `rustronomy_fits/` folder.
- rustronomy_fits uses the python package astropy as a reference to validate FITS files written during tests. Make sure to setup a python virtual environment with astropy and numpy installed to run these tests.
- to test the reading functionalities of rustronomy_fits, a number of test FITS files are used during testing. These are too large to be uploaded to github. You can download them using this link: [TODO]. Be sure to place them in the `resources/tests/` folder.
