# Rustronomy-fits - a Rustronomy tool for FITS file I/O
_This crate is part of the Rustronomy Project_
Rustronomy-fits provides I/O tools for reading, writing and parsing FITS files. It is currently still under heavy development.

### Features/Roadmap
Rustronomy-fits will support the following features (features marked with ✔️ have already been implemented):

_Reading Fits Files_
- ✔️ Parsing FITS headers and keyword records
- Parsing data in the primary HDU
  - ✔️ Images
  - ❌ Tables
  - ❌ Random Groups
- Parsing Extensions
  - ✔️ Images
  - ❌ Tables
 
_Writing Fits Files_
- Constructing a HDU (including auto header) from
  - ❌ an ndarray (to an Image)
  - ❌ a table (to a table)

# Quickstart
To use Rustronomy-fits in a cargo project, add the rustronomy-fits crate as a dependency to your `Cargo.toml` file:
```toml
[dependencies]
rustronomy-fits = "0.1.0"
```
To use Rustronomy-fits in a Jupyter notebook, execute a cell containing the following code:
```rust
:dep rustronomy-fits = {rustronomy-fits = 0.1.0}
```
### Example #1: Importing a FITS image as a ndarray
In this example we'll import an image as a ndarray. To start, we'll load the FITS file using `Fits::open(&path)`. This automatically reads the entire contents of the FITS file to memory and subsequently parses it into its constituent Header-Data-Units.
```rust
let path = PathBuf::from("somefile.fits"); //return type: Result<Fits, _>
let fits = Fits::open(&path)?;
```
The next step is to view the contents of the file. We can simply print the file:
```rust
print!("{fits}");
```
Output:
```
>=================================<|FITS File|>=================================
>Total File size in FITS blocks: 2678
>Number of Header-Data-Units: 2
>Contents:
>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
>  [HDU #0]
>  Total HDU size in FITS blocks: 1
>    [Header] - size: 1, #records: 4
>    [Data] - (NO_DATA)
>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
>  [HDU #1]
>  Total HDU size in FITS blocks: 2677
>    [Header] - size: 2, #records: 42
>    [Data] - (IMAGE) datatype: f64, shape: (956,1007), size: 2675
>===============================================================================
```
From the printout we can see that we have a `f64` image in the second HDU. HDU's are stored in the `Fits` struct, and contain a (printable) header and a variant of the `Extension` enum, which we must match to get out the desired image:
```rust
let hdu = fits.get_hdu(1).unwrap();
let data: &Array<f64, IxDyn>;

match hdu.get_data().unwrap() {
  Extension::Image(img) => {
    //This is the f64 image we wanted
    data = img.as_f64_array()?;
  } _ => {panic!()} //this HDU does not contain an Image
}
```
As implied above, this code obtains a reference to the image (in the future this will most likely be changed to an array-view). To get the owned array, we must deconstruct the `Fits` struct:
```rust
  let owned_hdu = fits.remove_hdu(1).unwrap();
  let (header, data) = owned_hdu.to_parts();
  let owned_array: Array<f64, IxDyn>;
  
  match data.unwrap() {
    Extension::Image(img) => {
      owned_array = img.as_owned_f64_array()?;
    } _ => {panic!()}
  }
```
### Example #2: Constructing a FITS file from an ndarray
_TODO - see roadmap_

### Notes on testing
If you want to contribute to this module, please keep in mind the following points regarding testing:
- all I/O tests make use of the `resources/tests/` folder, located in the root of the `rustronomy_fits/` folder.
- rustronomy_fits uses the python package astropy as a reference to validate FITS files written during tests. Make sure to setup a python virtual environment with astropy and numpy installed to run these tests.
- to test the reading functionalities of rustronomy_fits, a number of test FITS files are used during testing. These are too large to be uploaded to github. You can download them using this link: [TODO]. Be sure to place them in the `resources/tests/` folder.
