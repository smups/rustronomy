//! This module provides high-level API's for commonly used storage objects
//! in astronomy, such as Images and Tables. Crates in the rustronomy ecosystem
//! responsible for encoding/decoding specific file formats (such as [rustronomy-fits](https://github.com/smups/rustronomy-fits))
//! use the containers defined in this trait to facilitate easy data access and
//! conversion between storage formats.
//!
//! ## Metadata
//! All storage objects defined in this module may contain metadata represented
//! as `MetaDataTag`s, which are simple key-value pairs. Some metadata tags are
//! so commonly used in astronomy (such as a tag for the telescope or author)
//! that they have already been implemented here. In addition, users can add
//! their own metadata tags. For more info, see the metadata module.
