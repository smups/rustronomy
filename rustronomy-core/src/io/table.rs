//! This module specifies a table container. Tables consist of named columns
//! that hold a bunch of values of the same type. Tables should not be used to
//! store large amounts of data.
//!
//! Three column types are supported:
//! - `Integer` always a `Vec<i64>`
//! - `Float` always a `Vec<f64>`
//! - `Text` always a `Vec<String>`
