# Why 2 space tabs? Rust requires so much indentation that 4 space tabs often
# restrict the length of code that fits on one line.
#
# 2 space tabs are not a formal requirement for rustfmt, crate authors can use
# whatever they like, as long as they do so through configuring rustfmt
tab_spaces = 2

#allow for one-liners to take up a full line
